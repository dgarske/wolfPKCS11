wolfPKCS11 with Doxygen

---- Dependencies ----

- cmake
- make
- git
- doxygen
- latex (optional, for PDF generation; pdflatex provided by texlive)

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install LaTeX with:
  sudo apt install texlive texlive-latex-extra

---- Generating the Documentation ----

From the top-level wolfPKCS11 directory, run:

    make dox       # builds both HTML and PDF (PDF requires LaTeX)
    make dox-html  # builds only HTML
    make dox-pdf   # builds only PDF

The first run with -install will build doxygen from source if it is not found,
so the target may take longer the first time.

After generation:
- Open doc/html/index.html in a browser to view HTML documentation.
- The PDF (if built) will be available at doc/refman.pdf.

---- Notes on Configuration ----

Doxygen configuration files live under:
- doc/formats/html/Doxyfile  (HTML settings)
- doc/formats/pdf/Doxyfile   (PDF/LaTeX settings)

This documentation targets the public PKCS#11 API:
- wolfpkcs11/pkcs11.h
- wolfpkcs11/version.h

Internal sources and tests are excluded from the documentation.
